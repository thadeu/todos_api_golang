Created to study Golang

## Motivation

I'm a Ruby Developer with many years of experience, but I need to learn a new language to up my mindset. So, I decided to study Golang and its approachs.

## Features

- [x] Authentication (JWT)
- [x] Database (SQLite)
- [x] Logging
- [x] Telemetry (OpenTelemetry)
- [x] Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo)
- [x] Docker (Docker Compose)

## CLI commands

I didnt use Makefile instead I used to Taskfile ([taskfile.yml](taskfile.yml))

> To see all available commands, use `task --list-all`

```bash
* build-all:
* cover:
* default:  
* dev: 
* test:                          (aliases: t)
* test-watch:                    (aliases: tw)
* g:migration:             
* migrate:down:                  (aliases: md)
* migrate:up:                    (aliases: mu)
* monitoring:logs:               (aliases: mon:logs)
* monitoring:setup:              (aliases: mon:setup)
* monitoring:start:              (aliases: mon:start)
* monitoring:status:             (aliases: mon:status)
* monitoring:stop:               (aliases: mon:stop)
* run:monitored:                 (aliases: run:mon)

## Bin Aliases

Create an alias from bin's to /usr/loca/bin to easy run tests via CLI

```bash
sudo ln -fs $(pwd)/bin/gotest /usr/local/bin/gotest

sudo ln -fs $(pwd)/bin/gocover /usr/local/bin/gocover
```
